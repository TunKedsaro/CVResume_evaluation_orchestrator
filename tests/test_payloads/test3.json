      "summary": "Senior AI Engineer with 7+ years delivering production ML and LLM systems end-to-end: data pipelines, model training/serving, RAG, evaluation, and cloud deployment on GCP. Led orchestrator-based microservices for CV generation and resume evaluation with strict schema validation, structured logging/traceability, and token-cost monitoring. Strong in Python, FastAPI, BigQuery, vector search, CI/CD, and MLOps practices (testing, monitoring, rollout safety).",

            "Architected and shipped an orchestrator/BFF layer integrating Data API + LLM evaluator for resume scoring; enforced stable contracts (camelCase normalization, error envelope) and end-to-end correlation IDs for observability.",
            "Reduced candidate/profile hydration latency from ~80s to ~2.8s by consolidating BigQuery joins into a single optimized query and introducing caching; improved p95 response time by ~70% under load testing.",
            "Designed and implemented a HyDE-style retrieval pipeline (synthetic query generation + embeddings + top-k reranking) for role/job recommendation; improved top-5 retrieval precision from 0.52 → 0.71 on an internal labeled set (n=250).",
            "Built an automated LLM evaluation harness (golden set + regression tests + rubric scoring) and release checklist; reduced prompt regressions by ~60% and improved answer faithfulness by ~15% across 3 releases.",
            "Implemented production-grade reliability features: request timeouts, retries, circuit-breaking for downstream services, and structured logging of cost/latency; cut incident MTTR by ~40% via faster root-cause isolation.",
            "Led a 4-person squad (2 DE, 1 DS, 1 BE) to deliver an MVP in 8 weeks; aligned stakeholders on scope, KPIs, and acceptance criteria."
